I am a Building Services Engineer within the [Technical Conservation Teams](https://historicengland.org.uk/services-skills/our-planning-services/charter/our-technical-conservation-expertise/) at [Historic England](https://historicengland.org.uk) and I occasionally supervise MSc research at [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk).

I am a Chartered member of the [Institution of Mechanical Engineers](https://www.imeche.org) and interested in energy policy, sociotechnical energy transitions and sustainable buildings. This website documents my academic work and ongoing personal study within these fields.
