I am a Building Services Engineer within the [Technical Conservation Team](https://historicengland.org.uk/services-skills/our-planning-services/charter/our-technical-conservation-expertise/) at [Historic England](https://historicengland.org.uk). I undertake research projects related to climate resilience of buildings and disseminate findings through articles, technical guidance and webinars.

I am a Chartered member of the [Institution of Mechanical Engineers](https://www.imeche.org) and I occasionally supervise student research projects at [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk) as part of the MSc in [Sustainable Energy Systems](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/msc-taught/msc-sustainable-energy-systems).


This website documents my academic work and ongoing study within this evolving field.
