Listed building was introduced in 1882 to preserve and protect historic buildings. It was designed to respond to economic pressures that would otherwise see historic buildings altered, adapted or demolished. In light of contemporary challenges such as the climate crisis, it seems that listing can be a hindrance to delivering sustainable energy security to historic buildings. It begs a broader question around - how much is the climate crisis an existential threat to listed buildings - and does this outweigh the desire to (subjectively) visually protect them in this way?



## Listed Buildings and Renewable Energy Technologies 

There is a long-standing recognition and understanding of the value of historic buildings to culture, identity and social cohesion. We venerate and celebrate landmarks that are representative of different stages of our history and buildings become cultural artefacts that can capture struggle and aspirations of society.

In the UK some X% are protected through listing. This recognises the historical significance of such buildings and limits the modifications that can be made to them. It’s easy to understand how important this is, in a time where landlords are making shite decisions to make the most money in the shortest amount of time.

This demonstrates the value of listing and protecting such buildings. This is important not least to protect buildings from poor adaptation, but also to protect them from the property development.

Historically, listing has served the important purpose of aesthetic preservation, but this may be at odds with how we need buildings to adapt to contemporary challenges. Over the last 40 years buildings have changed drastically. Greater reliance on building services and highly coordinated energy systems means that they are much more complicated. Some buildings are effectively mini power plants that export electricity to the national grid. This new requirement means that even historic buildings are now being adapted towards such …

The listing building consent becoming a sticking point for low-carbon interventions. 
There comes a point where the precedence of listing must be questioned. At what point does the existential threat of high carbon emissions outweigh the desire to aesthetically subjectively protect historic buildings? The answer is highly debated amongst
