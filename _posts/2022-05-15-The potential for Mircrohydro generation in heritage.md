Despite being a well-established and mature technology, high capital costs, predominantly owing to civil engineering works, may deter investment and prevent use of a readily available energy resource. The historic built environment has the potential to overcome economic barriers associated with new hydroelectric schemes. Historic water mills, which would otherwise be stranded assets, have the potential to be re-purposed for hydroelectric power generation. As well as being favourably sited to maximise energy potential, readapting water mills has the potential to reduce the embodied carbon emissions and overall environmental impact compared to constructing a new hydropower scheme. Whilst there are numerous live examples of these projects across the UK, there is a need to integrate best practise such that the latent potential of micro hydro can be maximised where feasible.

Many heritage sites overseen by the National Trust have seen a strategic move towards installation of electrical generation equipment. This affords the capability of using electricty on site as well as exporting to the National Grid. This marrying of old and new will enable such sites to continue to remain relevant whilst supporting a lower carbon future in two ways. Firstly, by delivering clean energy, which offsets carbon emissions that would otherwise be generated. Secondly, it almost completely overcomes the issue of embodied carbon that is emitted when constructing infrastructure projects at this scale, through reuse and repurposing existing historic water mill sites.
