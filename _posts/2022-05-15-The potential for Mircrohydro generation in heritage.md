Despite being a well-established and mature technology, high capital costs, predominantly owing to civil engineering works, may deter investment and prevent use of a readily available energy resource. The historic built environment has the potential to overcome economic barriers associated with new hydroelectric schemes. Historic water mills, which would otherwise be stranded assets, have the potential to be re-purposed for hydroelectric power generation. As well as being favourably sited to maximise energy potential, readapting water mills has the potential to reduce the embodied carbon emissions and overall environmental impact compared to constructing a new hydropower scheme. Whilst there are numerous live examples of these projects across the UK, there is a need to integrate best practise such that the latent potential of micro hydro can be maximised where feasible.
