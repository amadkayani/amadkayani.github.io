As we move towards a low carbon future, organisational resilience has increasingly encompassed ‘green’ thinking. Many organisations realise that carbon footprint is an important stakeholder concern and this can impact their overall value proposition to end users. For assets that consume energy, and therefore emit carbon dioxide, questions arise around the long-term decarbonisation of assets and the cost incurred to this end. 

Typical carbon planning models observe operational carbon as an annual metric that is paid back over many years. This delivers a real carbon saving every year. This is usually extrapolated to a point in the distant future that projects a cumulative saving. Whilst this is useful is a simplistic back of the envelope calc, it fails to capture what happens in the real world, which is value inflation. 

The value of one tonne of carbon emitted today is intuitively different to the value of carbon emitted in 30 years. It is not easy to predict whether this value will be higher or lower, but the argument is predicated on the fact that the usefulness of saving that one tonne of carbon will inevitably change over a long enough time frame. The purpose of this paper is not to predict the real value of saving one tonne of carbon at various points in the future. This would be an impossible task that is highly path dependent. The objective of this is to set out observations over time that account for carbon inflation and carbon deflation, and to observe the differences in observed simplistic payback model.
