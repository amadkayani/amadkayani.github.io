Current low carbon decision-making is based on the assumption that the value of carbon does not change - this fails to capture the essence of the problem, which is urgency.


### Background

As the importance of a low carbon future becomes more widespread, we are seeing (and rightfully so) a shift towards ‘green’ thinking. Not surprisingly, due to the extent of the carbon problem, what this means exactly varies hugely amongst organisations. But most realised that carbon footprint is an important stakeholder concern, which can impact how their end users come to view them.  

Robust low carbon retrofit decision should encompass both embodied and operation carbon emissions, with the understanding that embodied carbon emissions are created when work is undertaken. Whilst comparing operational carbon savings with embodied carbon ‘sunk’ at the outset can be a useful way to rationalise long-term sustainability, it may fail to reflect the real essence of the carbon problem, which is environmental urgency.

Once we understand the urgency of reducing carbon emissions, it suddenly becomes very clear that the value of one tonne of carbon emitted today is intuitively different to the value of on tonne emitted in 30 years. It is not easy to predict whether this value will be higher or lower, but it is based on the understanding that the ‘usefulness’ of saving that one tonne of carbon will inevitably change over a long enough time-frame. 

How we quantify ‘usefulness’ of saving carbon is not an easy task, but using metrics we understand well, like inflation for financial value change, may be a good start. This may help us to quantify the impacts of the change in ‘usefulness’ through value inflation and deflation.

Based on this understanding, this short study sets out observations upon carbon payback models on the (a) simple carbon parity model, (b) carbon inflation model and (c) carbon deflation model. 


### Baseline Scenario: The Carbon Parity Model

This represents the typical approach to low-carbon decision making. An intervention is made to reduce emissions, by considering the embodied carbon incurred during the intervention and resultant savings per year. Eventually pay-back is achieved after a number of years, that may or may not justify the financial and carbon outlay. The business as usual (BAU) scenario is compared with an arbitrary retrofit scenario that saves annual operational carbon emissions. The following modelling simplifications are made:
a.	Operational carbon emissions remain consistently as 50 units of CO2 per year.
b.	The embodied carbon increases by 200 units of CO2 due to retrofit.
c.	Retrofit reduces the operational carbon emissions by 15 units of CO2 consistently over the subsequent years.

Observations:
1.	Pay-back is achieved in Year 19.
 
### The Carbon Inflation Model

This model assumes that the real value of carbon will diminish every year by 3%; saving the same tonne of carbon will be 3% less valuable next year in comparison to today.

Observations:
1.	Pay-back is achieved in Year 21, 2 years after the baseline model.
2.	The benefits delivered from the retrofit diminish year upon year.
  
 
### The Carbon Deflation Model

This model assumes that the real value of carbon will increase by every year by 3%; saving the same tonne of carbon will be 3% more valuable next year in comparison to today.

Observations:
1.	Pay-back is achieved in Year 15, 4 years earlier than the baseline model.
2.	The benefits delivered from the retrofit increase year upon year.

### Concluding Thoughts

If a carbon inflation model is applied – real value of carbon diminishes year on year, then the carbon payback period is prolonged. This would inhibit the potential benefit accrued from a low carbon retrofit as the embodied carbon would take longer to be matched in carbon saving.
Conversely, the carbon deflation model – real value of carbon increases, then the carbon payback is shortened. This implies that low-carbon interventions can deliver a shorter return on carbon saving. 
It is difficult to predict how the value of carbon will change. Given the urgency of the situation, we are likely to see higher carbon prices, but this may not be reflective of ‘value’. This assessment is predicated on assessing the ‘value’ or ‘usefulness’ of saving carbon from being emitted in the atmosphere. Given that the externalities are not factored into financial metrics, the carbon price will remain somewhat arbitrary and independent of ‘value’.
