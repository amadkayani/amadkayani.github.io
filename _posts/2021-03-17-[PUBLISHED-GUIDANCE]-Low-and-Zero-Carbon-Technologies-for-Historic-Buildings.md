In assessing the benefits of these low and zero carbon energy sources for historic buildings you will need to consider:

- Does it suit the particular building and use?
- What are the carbon reduction benefits?
- Will the potential savings exceed the whole-life energy costs?
- Can the system be fitted safely with no significant adverse impact on the building and its historic fabric
- What will be the visual impact on the setting of the building or heritage asset?
- Are there any planning controls that affect your choice and positioning of the installation?

These technologies, particularly those used for generating heat, are more effective within buildings with a highly energy efficient fabric, and where heat demand and loss have been reduced to a minimum.

The output of many of these energy supplies can fluctuate. They will often need to be balanced with electricity supplied from the National Grid, importing or exporting as required.

Apart from the initial set up costs, operation and maintenance costs, and de-commissioning of redundant systems need to be considered. These can be higher than for conventional supplies. Some systems can also have relatively short lifespans which can have implications for life-cycle value.
